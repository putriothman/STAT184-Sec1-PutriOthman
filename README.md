# Galton Data Stimulation
## Introduction
This repository contains the work for a STAT184 assignment focusing on data simulation and tidy data principles.
This project's objective was to comprehend and illustrate how tidy data concepts may be used to efficiently simulate and analyze data. Cleaning, organizing, and analyzing the data in R are the primary objectives and the dataset used is based on Galton's family height research.

## Implementation 
Several crucial steps were involved in the assignment:
1. **Cleaning Data**: We that the dataset complied with the tidy data principles, which state that every observation is a row, every variable is a column, and every kind of observational unit is a table.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Regression analysis was done to look for patterns in the data.

## Results or Conclusion
The analysis's findings show how clean data rules make analysis more efficient. These guidelines were used to convert the dataset into a format that made exploration and modeling easier.
**Lessons Learned** 
Through this assignment, I learned:
- How important tidy data is in order to simplify analyses. 
- How to use R for efficient data analysis and simulation.
These skills will definitely help me for future projects involving R.
